## Ideation

Idea is to set up a new rails project (primarily server logic) that shows how I like to build Rails applications and set up some of the more advanced data modeling and testing.

I think that starting with something already kind of set up will work better. Need to get boilerplate out of the way.

The idea is to add some crazy stuff that requires composition, advanced tests, error handling, and maybe API responses.

1. Model Setups and Clean Interfaces
2. Testing tips and tricks
3. Composition
4. Error handling
5. API design
